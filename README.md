# CS-210
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this project I had to follow specifications to design a digital clock that displayed the time in both 12 and 24 hour time.

What did you do particularly well?
I felt with this being the first C++ project I have done, I was able to get the formatting down for the display. I also felt like I was able to research how to accomplish different aspects of the project that I did not know how to do and was not in our readings.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I am not so sure about how I can enhance it to make it more secure, but maybe I could make improvements on this code to be formatted differently that might reduce the amount of code and its readablity. I do have a lot of cout << statements that could probably be condensed.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Clearing the screen so it didn't just repeat the clock and menu every time a selection was made. I was able to research how to do this properly, as different operating systems have different commands for it, so I wanted to make sure that the code worked properly no matter which operating system it was being run on.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Seeing as this was the first project, I think just getting all the basics down of C++ goes a long way. Also, having that thought in the back of my mind that one peice of code might work for one operating system, but it might not for another is always useful.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made it maintainable with the comments on it. It can be easily seen what each part of the code does. This also helps with readability. Now as I said before, I feel looking back on this I could have condensed some code which would have helped with readability as well. As far as being adaptable, again I look at the peice of code for clearing the screen, I made it adaptable to the OS that it is running on.
